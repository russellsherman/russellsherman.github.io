### Hello! I'm Russell Sherman.
I'm a start-up founder, software engineer, information security professional, and serial hobbyist living in Boulder, Colorado.

### About this website
This site is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  I've opted to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and a theme called [Texture](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/Texture-Theme/). Hoping to have an appropriate place to share thoughts, learnings, and experiences.
